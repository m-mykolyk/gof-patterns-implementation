The repository myroslav-mykolyk/gof-patterns-implementation offers a collection of basic implementations of the 23 classic ‚ÄúGang of Four‚Äù (GoF) design patterns using Java. These patterns are essential for understanding object-oriented design principles and are widely used to create flexible and maintainable software architectures.

üìò Repository Overview

This project serves as an educational resource, providing Java-based examples of the GoF design patterns. Each pattern is implemented in a straightforward manner to illustrate its core concept and usage. The repository is structured to facilitate learning and experimentation with these foundational design patterns.

üß± Implemented Design Patterns

The 23 GoF design patterns are categorized into three groups:

Creational Patterns
‚Ä¢	Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
‚Ä¢	Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
‚Ä¢	Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
‚Ä¢	Prototype: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new objects by copying this prototype.
‚Ä¢	Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Structural Patterns
‚Ä¢	Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
‚Ä¢	Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
‚Ä¢	Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
‚Ä¢	Decorator: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
‚Ä¢	Facade: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.
‚Ä¢	Flyweight: Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
‚Ä¢	Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Behavioral Patterns
‚Ä¢	Chain of Responsibility: Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.
‚Ä¢	Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
‚Ä¢	Interpreter: Given a language, defines a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
‚Ä¢	Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
‚Ä¢	Mediator: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
‚Ä¢	Memento: Without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an object‚Äôs internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
‚Ä¢	Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
‚Ä¢	State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
‚Ä¢	Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, letting the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
‚Ä¢	Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
‚Ä¢	Visitor: Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure, allowing you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements. Ôøº Ôøº
